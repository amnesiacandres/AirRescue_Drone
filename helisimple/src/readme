Version 0.2

This simple app reads image from the AR Drone and displays it on the screen.
If you click an object with distinct color, it will start to search for a largest object of that color in the image.
Pressing R makes the app forget the tracked color.
Q and A are takeoff and land, keypad numbers move the drone.
Z,X,C,V change camera.
Pressing ENTER saves current image. 

If you have a joystick, buttons 7 and 5 takeoff and land, buttons 1-4 switch cameras.
Axes 0-3 change angles and height.

The code is commented inside, start with main/heli.cpp so see how it works. 

COMPILING

Just type ''make'' in the src directory.
The soft needs standard libs and SDL-devel for the GUI.

ISSUES

Make sure your firewall accepts UDP connections on ports 5555 and 5557.
